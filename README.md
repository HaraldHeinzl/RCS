# RCS
Gaining more flexibility in Cox proportional hazards regression models with cubic spline functions

## Description
The Cox proportional hazards model is the most popular model for the analysis of survival data. The use of cubic spline funtions allows the investigation of non-linear effects of continuous covariates and the flexible assessment of time-by-covariate interactions. Two main advantages are provided - no particular functional form has to be specified and standard computer software packages can be used. The SAS macro RCS (restricted cubic splines) is available for implementing the method in SAS.

## Details
The rcs.zip-file contains the SAS macro RCS, a detailed description for its use, and three sample data sets. Note that the file "RCS.MAC" is a text-file. In case of problems opening this file, change the extension to "TXT" or "SAS". This will allow to open the RCS-macro code in a text-editor or directly in SAS.
